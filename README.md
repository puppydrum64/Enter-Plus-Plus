# Enter-Plus-Plus
Tired of forgetting semicolons? I created this macro to help. (Mostly as a joke.)
This macro is used by hitting Ctrl+Enter, it's the same as typing a semicolon then hitting the enter key.
You may need to edit your Notepad++ shortcuts, if anything is already assigned to Ctrl+Enter this won't work.
